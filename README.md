# InnoSetup.WindowsVersion

Utilities for handling Windows versions. Don't detection of allwindos versions versios, especially very old ones. Should cover, as is, all versions uspported by microsoft.

Should add dates to versions when their support ends. Then most likely would need to handle Enterprice versions also, because those seem to have longer support, but maybe not, people should really keep theeir OS more than less up to date, I think.
