# InnoSetup.WindowsVersion

Utilities for handling Windows versions. Don't detect all windows versions, especially very old ones. Should cover, as is, all versions uspported by microsoft and more tough.

Should add dates to versions when their support ends. Then most likely would need to handle Enterprice/LTS versions also, because those seem to have longer support, but maybe not, people should really keep their OS more than less up to date, I think.
